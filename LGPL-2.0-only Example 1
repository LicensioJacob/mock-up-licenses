#This license was released: June 1991. This license has been superseded by LGPL-2.1. This license identifier refers to the choice to use the code under LGPL-2.0-only, as distinguished from use of code under LGPL-2.0-or-later (i.e., LGPL-2.0 or some later version). The license notice (as seen in the Standard License Header field below) states which of these applies to the code in the file. The example in the exhibit to the license shows the license notice for the "or later" approach.
