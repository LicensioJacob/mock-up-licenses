#PREAMBLE

#The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of cooperative font projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide an open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.

#The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and sold with any software provided that the font names of derivative works are changed. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of license.

#DEFINITIONS

#"Font Software" refers to any and all of the following:

#- font files
#- data files
#- source code
#- build scripts
#- documentation
#"Reserved Font Name" refers to the Font Software name as seen by users and any other names as specified after the copyright statement.

#"Standard Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as distributed by the Copyright Holder.

#"Modified Version" refers to any derivative font software made by adding to, deleting, or substituting â€” in part or in whole -- any of the components of the Standard Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a new environment.

#"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

#3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font Name(s), in part or in whole, unless explicit written permission is granted by the Copyright Holder. This restriction applies to all references stored in the Font Software, such as the font menu name and other font description fields, which are used to differentiate the font from others.
